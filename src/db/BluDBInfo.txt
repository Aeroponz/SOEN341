	3. click 'Shell' to open the XAMPP Terminal.
	4. type # cd mysql/bin
	5. type # mysql.exe -u root
	6. determine the root filepath for db/
	7. type >source [filepath]/db/Setup/BluTableSetup.sql;
	8. type >source [filepath]/db/Setup/BluDataSetup.sql;
	8. database "bluData" has been created along with five tables with dummy data.

[Abstract Connection to Database]
If you want to connect to Database in PHP the following must be done:
	- At the start of each of your .PHP files you must have:
	
		<?php require_once('../../db/DBConfig.php'); ?> //filepath may need to be altered
		
	- Within your php sections, use the following format for your connections:
	
		<?php
			//Establish the database connection instance.
			$db_connection_var = Database::getConnection();
			
			... Queries done here ...
			
			//Deallocate memory and clear connection.
			$db_connection_var = null;
		?>
